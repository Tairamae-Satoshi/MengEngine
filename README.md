This is a skeleton animation engine. And a procedural character locomotion system with simple controller is implemented in this engine...



#### Features:

* Basic Animation Feature
  * Skeleton Animation
  * Animation sampling
  * Animation blending
    - linear blending
    - Inertialization

  * Linear skinning
* Advanced Animation Features
  * Blendspace
    * Motion analysis (used to align the key time)
    * Gradient band interpolation
  * Motion Matching
    * Spring Controller
    * Trajectory matching
    * Pose matching(Only position for now)
  * IK Rigging
    * Two bone IK
    * Aim IK
